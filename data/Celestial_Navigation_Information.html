<h1><u>Celestial Navigation Plugin for OpenCPN</u></h1>
<hr>

<h2><u>Introduction</u></h2>

<p>The plugin helps determine your position (Latitude, Longitude) through
sextant "altitude" observations of the Sun, Moon, planets, or stars. The plugin
can work together with a OpenCPN DR Track, GPS Track, or without a route.
Celestial Navigation serves as a reliable independent backup when GPS is
unavailable, spoofed, or fail during long ocean voyages. It displays a Circle of
Position (COP) for each sight. On a small area scaled plot, COP appears as a
Line of Position. It calculates Intercept and Azimuth, calculates and displays a
FIX from multiple celestial body sights. And will calculate a Running fix by
advancing Lines of Position based on Vessel distance traveled and course between
sights. It supports Lunar Distancing which was used to determine TIME (Greenwich
Meridian, then GMT, now UT/UTC) before widespread availability of chronometers.
Also notable, Lunars can be done as a "backyard" sight without using a visible
horizon. A future feature is Azimuth sights.

<h2>Sights Dialog</h2>

<p>When the plugin is opened, the Sights dialog shows sights that have been
input. Select <i>New</i> to enter a new sight. <i>Duplicate</i> an existing
sight. <i>Edit</i> to view and make changes to an existing sight. <i>Delete</i>
a sight or <i>Delete All sights</i>. <i>Hide/Show</i> Button will show or hide
the sights. Alternatively, move the forms out of the way.

<p>When a new sight is entered, its Circle of Position (COP) defaults on the
chart.  Select/unselect the <i>Eye</i> icon. There is no limit and no
performance impact with the number of sights. But the more sights with the
"eye" icon turned on, the longer it takes to open the plugin.

<h3>Sight Tab (required)</h3>

Sight Measurement (Hs) is an angular measurement of an astronomical body using a
sextant. It can be one of these types:

<ul>
<li>Altitude: Angle of the body above the horizon (most common method)</li>
<li>Lunar: angle from the moon to another body for TIME and assessing
Watch error (number of min-sec fast or slow).</li>
<li>Azimuth: (Future. Some framework is available)</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Celestial Body</b>: select the Sun, Moon, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,
Mercury, and 57 Navigation Stars plus Polaris that are visible in either the
Northern or Southern Hemisphere. For Lunar sights, the Celestial body is the
body paired with the Moon to measure the Angular distance to the Moon.

<p><b>Limb</b>: For altitude shots of the Sun and Moon, choose lower limb unless
obscured; then choose upper limb. For lunar sights select Near or Far to
represent whether the celestial body is brought across to the Near side or Far
side of the Moon. Also for Lunar sights, if celestial body is the Sun, select
Upper or Lower Limb for the Altitude sight. And choose the Limb of the Moon for
its altitude sight.

<p><b>Sight Measurement (Hs)</b>: Enter the sextant reading. 3 angle formats are
supported: Degrees minutes, Degrees Minutes Seconds, Decimal Degrees. After
input, the angle redisplay is per Open CPN's display settings. New feature:
Back-sights are supported.

<p><b>Minutes of certainty</b> determine the width of the plotted circle or line
of position COP/LOP. If too small, it is hard to see. 0.1 min. is visible after
zooming into a small area chart. 10+ min. visible after zooming out into a large
area chart.

<p><b>TIME</b> (Lunars only). When TIME button is pressed, the computed UTC TIME
and how much faster or slower it is to the sight's UTC input is displayed.
Before pressing button, complete the remaining sight data.

<p><b>FIND</b>. When this button is pressed, the sight input data is "reduced"
using the Law of Cosines. Before using the computations, confirm your vessel's
DR Latitude &amp; Longitude on the form and after that, finish the remaining
sight data. Lat &amp; Lon defaults from Open CPN's "Your Boat" position.  Change
Lat. &amp; Long. using Open CPN Degree Minute, Deg. Min. Sec. or Decimal Deg.
formats. Caution: input E or W for Longitude. N and S for Latitude is optional
when using +degrees For North Lat, -degrees for South Lat. The position change
is saved with the sight. After the rest of the sight data is input (Time tab,
Parameters Tab), the LOP/COP and Law of Cosines calculations are usable:
Computed Altitude (Hc) which is the altitude the celestial body should have
(Nautical Almanac data) if the vessel was at the DR location.  Azimuth (Zn),
which is the bearing (True or Magnetic) to the body. Intercept, which is the
distance (in nautical miles) from the vessel's DR position towards (Ho &gt; Hc)
or away (Ho &lt; Hc) from the body's LOP. New feature: Estimated Altitude (Hs).
An estimate for the sextant sight. Use it to pre-set your Sextant before taking
sights. It, along with Azimuth (Zn) can be used as a "star or planet finder" for
a future UTC time &amp; DR.

<h3>Time (UTC) Tab (Required)</h3>

Must be the exact moment of your sight measurement at UTC. Know the time zone
where you are taking your sights. Know your watch error.

<p><b>Date and Time</b> defaults to the system clock date &amp; time and time
zone when a New sight form is opened. Date &amp; Time needs to be the UTC date
&amp; time. Example: twilight sight is recorded at 20:25:35 April 22 at UTC-4,
also known as ZD+4. The UTC is April 23, 20xx and UTC is 00:25:35. The next day!

<p><b>Time (Hours, Minutes, Seconds)</b> needs to be UTC after accounting for
Watch error. Be aware of Daylight savings time. There is no Daylight Savings
time for UT/UTC. A digital watch or quartz watch with UTC and local time is
best. Be sure to manually adjust Time to correspond with the exact UTC moment
the sight was taken. Example: If your quartz watch is 5 sec Fast, then convert
to UTC and subtract 5 sec. If your watch is 1 minute 10 seconds slow, then ADD 1
minute 10 seconds to your UTC.

<p><b>Recording</b>: In preparation, set the stopwatch and record UTC time.
When the sight is taken, say “Mark”, so the assistant can record stopwatch time
and the sight body and altitude, or if you are solo, try using a recording timer
app on your cell phone with a wired microphone. A plot of stopwatch time against
Hs can show outlier sights.

<p><b>Time Certainty</b> default is 0 seconds which shows a signal darker line
in the COP. A time Certainty of &gt; 0 shows two darker lines, equivalent to
that many seconds apart. For Lunar Sights, Time Certainty is used to bracket
your watches's +/- error. The default of 10800 sec can be changed. A COP or LOP
is not shown for Lunar Sights.

<h3>Parameters Tab (to review and update as required)</h3>

This is where Index Error, Height of Eye, Temp/Pressure of the sight is entered.
You can save these settings as a default. Then they are used Automatically used
for future NEW sights (not used for past sights or Duplicate sights).

<p>New feature: Artificial Horizon sights are supported. And Dip Short sights
are supported. For Dip short, determine the Distance in nautical Miles to the
shoreline the celestial object is brought down to. Use an OpenCPN chart and use
the measure tool.

<h3>Back to the Sights Tab</h3>

After the Sight is completely input, REVIEW. Look at the FIND Form and TIME form
(Lunars only) found in the Sights Tab. Look at the LOP/COP that was redrawn.
Look at the Intercept. Do they make sense?

<h3>Calculations Tab (optional)</h3>

Shows the corrections or adjustments of sextant measured sight to Altitude
Observed (Ho). Includes formulas and adjustments like Index Correction, Dip or
Dip Short correction, Limb Correction, Refraction correction, and Parallax
Correction. All angles are shown in decimal degrees and degrees minutes. This is
to support verification of the sight data and collaboration. For Lunars, it
shows the complete calculation from the Sextant measurements to TIME
determination.

<h3>Config Tab (optional)</h3>

Changing color and transparency appearance does not affect the results.

<h3>DR Shift Tab (only if Vessel moved between sights used for a FIX).</h3>

Update the DR Shift Tab for the 1st through next to last sight that you'll use
for a FIX. Enter Distance and TRUE Bearing from the first sight to the Last
Sight of the Fix. If you maintain a DR Plot, Open CPN's Measurement tool is
available to measure distance and bearing (course). You’ll see the earlier
LOP/COP shifted or advanced. Do the Same for the 2nd sight, 3rd sight, etc. The
Last sight is not shifted.

<h3>Fix Button (Sights dialog form)</h3>

The Fix is determined from the sights with COPs made visible. Careful! Hide the
sights you don't want included in the Fix or Running Fix. If DR Shift was not
used, this FIX button will not consider Time and whether the Vessel moved
between your first to last sight. Two or more sights with COP visible are
needed. The algorithm first seeks a Fix nearest "Your Boat". If it doesn’t find
it, enter the closest dead reckoning latitude and longitude, and try again. When
a Fix is found, a 2 cm long red X is displayed on the chart. Does the FIX make
sense? If not, you might have included some unintended sights. Find them and
make them invisible.

<p>After finding the Fix, use Core CPN functionality to drop a Waypoint and
label it at the FIX position so Fix is shown on your DR Track.

<p>When the Fix button is closed the X disappears from the chart.

<p>The Fix algorithm uses the least squares regression to find a position at sea
level for altitude type of sights. It is not implemented for shifted sights,
sights taken above sea level altitudes, and true north azimuth type of sights.

<h3>Clock Offset Tab (Sights Dialog form). (Optional)</h3>

Many traditional navigators set Clock Offset to 0 because they already
compensated for watch error in the individual sights before UTC input Clock
Offset or Correction adjusts and redraws all stored sights (shown or not). It
can be used to set DeltaT, although the plugin calculates celestial objects
value using current DeltaT formulas. Sean suggests adjusting the global "Clock
Offset" until COP converge to determine local clock accuracy. No matter how
Watch Error is adjusted, do it consistently to ensure precise navigational
calculations based on celestial observations.

<h2>Common Problems</h2>

Circle of Position or sight is not appearing. If you do not see a COP, ensure
the visible (eye) icon appears in the Sight List, zoom out and pan the earth to
find it. change certainty minutes to make the COP/LOP line thicker, change UTC,
DR location and use the Estimated Hs. Hs of 90 degrees is almost a point and is
the Latitude and Longitude of the GP of the body. Calculations tab show the
Body’s Latitude, Longitude,

<p>The Find button’s Altitude (Hc) and Azimuth (Zn) is way off from what you
expected. The Hc and Zn defaults to the "Your Boat" DR location position. Was
"move boat" used to move the boat to the DR location of the sight? When using
the "your boat" Default, the location of the boat is not saved. The sight's DR
moves because the Boat Moves (e.g. hooked up to GPS for instance). New Feature:
Options. Move the boat to the Sight DR location, uncheck "Boat Position". Then
the sight's DR is saved. An easier option is to input (or copy/paste) the DR
location of where the sight was taken.

<p>With this new release, old sights with the DR location manually input will be
initialized with Latitude 0, Longitude 0. Reason - previously release didn't
save the DR.

<h2>Reduce Errors:</h2>

<p><b>Adjustable errors</b>. Prior to sight taking, adjust your sextant to
remove errors.

<p><b>Index Error.</b> Reverify your index error using the horizon. IE is part
of your sight measurement.

<p><b>Height of Eye.</b> Measure your height of eye above the water line. This
is part of your sight measurements. Natural Horizon, Dip Short, Artificial
Horizon are supported.

<p><b>Run of Sights</b>: For each body, take a run of 3 to 5 sights, a minute or
so between sights. Input the entire run into the Celestial Navigation Sights
form. Look at the Circle of Positions for these sights. Throw out the sights
that look like errors. If they all look good, consider calculating an average
sight altitude and average sight time. Average has been shown to substantially
reduce sight error.

<p><b>Multi-Body Sights</b>: To get the best possible Fix, try to take a 3-body
sight within 20-minutes. Sun, Moon, Venus can make a good 3 body sight. Ensure
the celestial bodies are adequately spaced. Two bodies should be 45 to 135
degrees apart. For three bodies, the 3rd outer bodies should be over 30 and less
than 120 degrees from the other two bodies. Consider inputing all sights of each
run into the Sights form. The duplicate sight feature makes it quick and easy.
All of the sights can be visible. The FIX form can calculate a Fix from of all
this data. Or make visible the best of each body’s COP. The three body COPs will
make a triangle.

<p><b>Running Fix</b>: If the bodies were taken hours apart and are 45 to 135
degrees apart, it could be considered a Running Fix, the next best thing to a
Fix. The quality of the running fix depends on maintaining a careful DR plot.
The morning Sun and afternoon Sun make a good Running Fix. Use the DR Shift tab
to advance the morning's to the afternoon's sight. Bearing should consider set
and drift (current)

<p><b>Correct Time</b>: Celestial navigation requires precise time.

<p><b>Watch Error</b>: Monitor the quartz watch against Marine Radio frequencies
to determine its accuracy for the day. The navigator records and tracks their
watch's error trend to estimate the day’s watch error.

<p><b>Practice</b>: The more sights you take and input into Celestial Navigation
Plugin, the more accurate your sights will become. Many beginners start off with
5 nm accuracy and improve to 3 nm accuracy. Experts are accurate to better than
1 nm. And the inscribed circle of a 3 or 4 Body fix can consistently be better
than 0.5 nm.

<p><b>Personal Bias Error</b>: To determine their average personal bias error,
navigators track their sight history (hundreds of sights) to determine average
personal bias. Most understand the reason for bias.

<p>For <b>Lunars</b>, review the Lunars Training document. There is extensive
suggestions on achievable accuracy and methods to improve accuracy.

<h2>Navigation in principle</h2>

<p>Of course, if you already know where you are, there is no point in trying to
determine it from the formulas above. But when you actually navigate, the odds
are you don't know quite where you are, so how do we use the above formulas?

<p>We draw what is called a position line or Sumner line. Although the modern
position line is not quite a real Sumner line, but it is close enough.

<p>Like all good inventions, Sumner lines were discovered by chance by a fellow
called, you guessed right, &quot;Sumner&quot;, Thomas H. Sumner to be precise
(maybe related to the late professor Julius Sumner-Miller). Sumner was a ship
captain on his way from Charleston (South Carolina) to Greenock (Scotland). And
he was worried because he had been sailing for several days in bad weather, the
wind was blowing from the Southeast making Ireland a lee shore, and he had not
been able to see the sun or any stars, the coast was getting near, and he did
not know exactly where he was. Suddenly there was a break in the clouds, so he
grabbed his sextant and snatched a quick sun sight, before the clouds covered
the sky again.

<p>Now he was wondering what to do with this information, so he played a
&quot;what if&quot; game. He did not use the bearing formula above, because
nobody had worked it out in quite that form yet, but he knew the altitude
formula and he said, &quot;what if my latitude is... &quot; and calculated the
corresponding longitude and he plotted it on the chart, then he tried it again
with another latitude, got another point on the chart. After doing that three or
four times he suddenly realized that all the points he was marking on the chart
seemed to fall on a straight line. Without thinking about it anymore, he saw
that the line needed pushing north by a few odd miles to lead straight over
Small's light, so he turned north for those few miles, then turned to starboard
until he was sailing parallel to that very first &quot;Sumner line&quot;. His
crew were a bit perplexed at that, wondering if the captain had gone mad, but
when suddenly they arrived right at the very light, they thought he was a
flaming genius. And so did the rest of the sailing community.

<p>So why did the points fall on a straight line? They did not really but Sumner
did not realize it at the time. The points Sumner was plotting were the points
on earth from which anyone would have seen, at the same moment as he did, the
sun with exactly the same altitude. All those points are on a circle centered at
the point on earth directly below the sun. Because this circle is usually huge,
a small part of it appears straight on a Mercator projection chart.

<p>So this is how we proceed in practice:

<ol>
<li>We assume we know where we are, we call this DR (for Dead Reckoning).</li>
<li>We calculate, based on the latitude and longitude of the DR, what the
bearing and the altitude of the celestial object would be at the time of
observation.</li>
<li>We draw the bearing line passing through DR.</li>
<li>We compare the actual measured altitude with what it would have been
had we been at DR, the difference, in minutes of arc, is equal to the number of
nautical miles that we have to move along the bearing line to find our position
line. ie if the angle measured is greater than the calculated one by say 13' of
arc, then we move towards the celestial object by 13 nautical miles, and if say
the measured angle was less by 7' of arc than the calculated one, we would move
away from the celestial object by 7 nautical miles.</li>
<li>Finally, draw a line at the right angle to the bearing line, passing by the
point we have just found. This line is our position line and all we can tell is
we are somewhere on this line.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note the difference between our position line and Sumner's original one: our
line is the tangent to the circle at the point nearest to DR, Sumner's was the
circle. Sumner's line is in theory more accurate, but the circle is usually so
large that the loss of accuracy is insignificant. Note also that in the tropics
the circles can be extremely small, I remember reading about a P&amp;O captain
who used to obtain all his fixes without any calculation, he would take several
observations when the sun was nearly dead overhead (say over a 15 minute period)
for each time observation, he would plot the coordinates (GHA,DEC) of the Sun on
his map then draw a circle of radius equal to (90 degrees - measured altitude).
Since over the 15-minute period he would probably have collected 4 or 5
observations, he would draw 4 or 5 circles which would all intersect at one
point. Simple but effective, especially as in the tropics, position lines
usually end up running almost North-South giving good longitude information but
lousy intercepts and large errors in latitude. The noon sight is damn important
then.

<p>If you wait a few hours, the sun will change position, and you will be able
to repeat the operation and determine a 2nd position line which will intersect
the first. Provided you haven't moved in the interval, you are at the
intersection.

<p>If you have moved (and the odds, are you would because it can be pretty
boring sitting around doing nothing on a boat that's just bobbing up and down in
the middle of the ocean), then all you need do is translate the original
position line in the same direction, and the same distance as you have
travelled. Your position will be at the intercept of the new line and the
translated one. Sailors call this the SUN RUN SUN method.

<h2>Accuracy Testing Procedures</h2>

<ol>
<li>Periodic report of Celestial Navigation Plugin accuracy and precision
against the Commercial Edition of the Nautical Almanac. To be done during
upgrades or as part of an annual or every other year review.</li>
<li>Calculation (NA versus Plugin) using 3 statistics (see below)</li>
<li>Results are summarized on the Celestial Navigation Plugin webpage. </li>
<li>Users will know the accuracy and precision to expect from the plugin.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Established Accuracy Goal</h2>

<ol>
<li>Mean and Standard Deviation of the Differences. Our target standard
deviation is 0.1 nm or 0.1 minutes.</li>
<li>Percent of observations with 0 difference. Nautical Almanac data is no
finer than 0.1 minutes. Celestial Navigation data will normalize to the
same precision for purpose of apples-to-apples comparison. </li>
<li>Percent of observations greater than 0.1 minute or less than 0.1 minutes.
Due to rounding at .1, these observation differences would be .2 minutes or
larger.</li>
<li>0.1 minutes, which is equivalent to 0.1 nautical miles is 600 feet, 185
meters</li>
</ol>
